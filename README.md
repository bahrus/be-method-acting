# be-method-acting (ðŸŽ­) [TODO]

be-method-acting is an HTML behavior/enhancement that is specifically tailored for web components that are [round-about ready](https://github.com/bahrus/trans-render/wiki/II.--Signals-vs-Roundabouts).

Like [be-invoking](https://github.com/bahrus/be-invoking), it can launch a method from the host or a peer element on demand.  But what be-method-acting adds to the mix is the ability to merge the results of the method into the target element.
